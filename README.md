## Welcome to my lab!

Here is where I keep bits and pieces of code I write when experimenting. Be it sandbox environments for that shiny new tech I heard last week on a podcast, precious snippets reused many times since they were carefully crafted, or emergent/drafty attempts to compose something cool, there's no definitive rule here. 

Exploring this maze might feel like stepping into a hobbyist workspace. Many things are unrelated and it looks like quite a mess at first, though if you ask the craftsperson to show you around, they might take you on quite an interesting journey.
